          Forgiveness is the fragrance that the violet sheds on the heel that
          has crushed it.” – Mark Twain

          Life sometimes seems to be rife with situations that require
          forgiveness- either from you or towards you. That’s because despite
          what we may strive for, no one is ever perfect. But what’s important
          is that we hold that flower of forgiveness in our soul and remember to
          actively work on forgiving those who have hurt us (whether they
          intended to or not). But even if we are the ones who need forgiveness,
          it’s important to be kind to yourself and remember that mistakes are
          how we learn and grow in this life.

          If you would like a little magical oomph of support for your situation
          needing forgiveness, I will cast a druidic spell with natural
          materials and an invocation to bring awareness of the need for
          forgiveness for you or someone you care for at my altar. Just knowing
          that someone out there believes in you and has taken an intentional
          act of positivity on your behalf can be so helpful in your fight for
          inwards strength, growth, and positivity.
        </p>

          My Forgiveness Spell will influence the universe into providing
          forgiveness, whether that be for yourself or someone else. Sometimes
          people can be stubborn, or it seems like you guys just can’t work
          things out without bringing up the past. This spell will plant the
          seed of forgiveness where it can have the opportunity to grow.
        </p>

          Magic works best when it is tackled in both magical and non-magical
          ways, so make sure you’re doing what you can to help the spell along.
          It’s like hitting an issue from both sides instead of one.
